        <h1>Rootless Jailbreak</h1>
        <h3>Why do iOS 15 jailbreaks have to be rootless?</h3>
        <span style="line-height: 25px;">Normal jailbreaks inject files into root directories like /Applications, /etc
            and so on. <br><br> In <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/">iOS 15</a>, <a
                href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2021/09/22/ios-15-and-jailbreaking-f-a-q/">Apple introduced a new
                integrity check</a> which checks for modified system
            files. If they are detected, your device will be put into <a
                href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/DFU_Mode">DFU mode</a> and you have to restore it. For this
            reason, we need a jailbreak that does not inject into system directories, but only user directories like
            /var.</span>
        <h3>Okay, but what is a rootless jailbreak?</h3>
        <span style="line-height: 25px;">A rootless jailbreak only gets root privilages to /var. <br> And that's it.
            <br><br> This makes most jailbreak detections not detect anything, but also supports less tweaks.</span>
        <h3>Will jailbreaking be dead for iOS 15 and onwards?</h3>
        <span style="line-height: 25px;">For iOS 15, no. We just need new ways to jailbreak, such as rootless jailbreaks
            (not new, but now needed) <br><br>For iOS 16+, we don't know yet. They might implement more checks, they
            might allow jailbreaking at its whole.</span>
